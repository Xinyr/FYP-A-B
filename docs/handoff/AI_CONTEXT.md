# FinSight ingestion — AI context

Read this before modifying or consuming Chia's ingestion layer. It is an orientation map: follow the linked source/architecture/tests for authoritative definitions rather than treating this as a second schema.

## Default consumer path

**Default downstream input: accepted canonical records.**

```text
Public TypeScript route: consolidate(results).normalized
JSON evidence route:   datasets[].normalized
Do NOT use by default: datasets[].records (or IngestionResult.records)
```

`normalized` includes **VALID and WARNING** records with messages and provenance. `records` includes raw/staging evidence, partial candidates and **REJECTED** rows. Never forward rejected candidates as analysis input by default. Acceptance proves provisional ingestion eligibility, not client accounting accuracy or model readiness.

## Identity, state and ownership

Topic 21 — Finance Intelligence; COS40005 Project A/Sprint 1. This snapshot originates from Chia's development repository `finsight-prototype` and is shared for team integration through `Xinyr/FYP-A-B`; Chia owns ingestion/consolidation.

**IMPLEMENTED / TEAM INTEGRATION SNAPSHOT — prepared 2 October 2026:** reusable TypeScript ingestion engine, browser-memory Data-page PoC, human/AI handoffs, tested consumption example, reader hardening and verification evidence. This snapshot is intended for the shared branch `feature/data-ingestion-chia`, is **not merged into `main`**, and active development continues separately in Chia's development repository. Check the current branch, files and tests before making integration assumptions.

**PROVISIONAL:** canonical schema/ruleset `0.1` and client-dependent conventions. **FUTURE:** backend/database/API, AI, reconciliation and dashboard integration. Other application pages remain mock-driven; uploaded data does not populate them.

Frederick owns AI/forecasting/insights, Celester backend/database/APIs, Jason cybersecurity, and Izzat dashboard/frontend visualization. Their final interfaces are **REQUIRES TEAM CONFIRMATION**. Describe our boundary; do not invent or implement their modules.

## Sources of truth and file map

| Read | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [models.ts](../../lib/ingestion/models.ts) | Actual types, defaults, versions and provenance structures |
| [architecture.md](../ingestion/architecture.md) | Financial semantics, rules, metrics, limits and change policy |
| [index.ts](../../lib/ingestion/index.ts) | Public engine imports; internal module map is in architecture |
| [consume.ts](../../examples/ingestion/consume.ts) | React-independent, version-gated synchronous visitor recipe |
| [handoff.test.ts](../../tests/ingestion/handoff.test.ts) and [existing tests](../../tests/ingestion/) | Executable behavior and independently specified fixture checks |
| [README](../../README.md), [demo](../ingestion/demo.md), [verification](../ingestion/verification.md) | Run commands, unchanged UI flow and measured checks |

`app/data/page.tsx` and `components/ingestion/` are UI/session orchestration, not downstream integration APIs. Engine imports must not flow through them. Reuse `lib/ingestion/index.ts`; do not reparse CSV/XLSX in Fred's module. A Node consumer can use the TypeScript engine; another language uses agreed JSON semantics, not a direct TypeScript import.

Node file adapters can pass `readFileSync(path)` directly to `inspectFile`; consumers need not copy Buffer input manually. The reader owns exactly the supplied Uint8Array view before hashing, CSV decoding and XLSX inspection/parsing, including sliced or pooled Node Buffers. The [reader regressions](../../tests/ingestion/readers-buffer.test.ts) exercise both Buffer and ordinary Uint8Array views with unrelated surrounding bytes. The handoff fixture loader passes direct Buffers and independently compares SHA-256 against the file bytes.

Earlier academic planning deliverables include proposed signed-cash, VALID-only and persistence conventions that predate the current implementation. They remain historical documents. Do not silently edit them or substitute those proposals for the source/architecture/tests.

## Invariants and compatibility

- Preserve separate source transaction/posting dates and explicit canonical date/basis; no silent date substitution.
- Preserve money as decimal strings and identifiers as text. No floating-point coercion, universal sign reinterpretation, mixed-source monetary totals or currency conversion. Ledger-derived net remains explicitly ledger-specific.
- Keep warning messages, source coordinates, hashes, batch/time lineage, currency origin and approved transformations. Source row IDs are not persistent database IDs or economic deduplication keys.
- Keep deterministic exact/alias/normalized-name suggestions, manual overrides and explicit mapping/convention approval. Do not introduce fuzzy/LLM/embedding mapping or manufacture approval to bypass review.
- The consumer recipe intentionally supports schema/ruleset `0.1` independently. It checks **every supplied result before consolidation and before visiting any record**, including results that would be replaced. Update compatibility only after reviewing changes; do not auto-adopt producer constants.
- JSON consumers must check the envelope and each dataset version before visiting accepted rows. The recipe trusts engine-produced objects and is not runtime validation of arbitrary JSON. JSON Schema and production transport are deferred.
- Browser-memory processing, session deduplication and parsed source evidence are PoC limits, not a final persistence/security architecture. An approval flag is not proof of authorized server-side ingestion.
- The example uses synchronous visitors and performs no network/storage operations. A callback must treat records as read-only; callback failures are not rolled back and async publishing is not implemented.

## Synthetic example and verification

**SYNTHETIC EXAMPLE · NOT CLIENT DATA · NOT A PRODUCTION API CONTRACT:** [engine-generated evidence JSON](examples/ingestion-evidence.json). Generated from controlled public consultation fixtures with Details → reference correction, batch ID `synthetic-handoff-example-batch-001`, and fixed UTC instant `2026-10-02T00:00:00.000Z`. No label-only metadata is inserted and no lineage field is repurposed for disclaimers.

Expected observation: **26 processed; 23 visited = 20 VALID + 3 WARNING; 0 REJECTED visited**. Rejected evidence remains in the separate `records` arrays. Read relevant accepted/evidence sections; the entire audit export is not the proposed production transport.

```bash
pnpm test tests/ingestion/handoff.test.ts
```

This checks actual visited IDs/statuses and warnings/lineage, compatibility before side effects, strings/date semantics, replacement behavior, and byte equality to the exporter plus a final newline. Independent fixture counts/examples are checked before comparison. Authoring-only regeneration uses `FINSIGHT_REGENERATE_HANDOFF_EXAMPLE=1 pnpm test tests/ingestion/handoff.test.ts`; normal tests never rewrite the example. Full commands/results are in README/verification. The supplied 6,000-row workbook is optional; labels/ground-truth sheets are not transaction input or measured model accuracy.

## Task boundaries and unresolved decisions

Do not change other feature pages, shared mock finance modules, production/configuration/environment files, dependencies, formal university submissions, or other members' code for ingestion work. Do not add backend persistence, forecasting, reconciliation, authentication, integrations or UX redesign as incidental improvements. If a requested task requires a financial contract change, use the architecture change policy and identify affected consumers first.

**REQUIRES TEAM CONFIRMATION:** accepted-data interchange, persistent IDs/batch ownership, API/storage/retention, downstream keys and warning eligibility. **REQUIRES CLIENT CONFIRMATION:** actual source conventions, required fields/date basis/currencies and exception policies. Preserve source meaning and flag unknowns rather than inventing answers. Security/privacy guarantees remain limited to the controls documented in architecture.

Suggested cross-tool instruction: “Read `docs/handoff/AI_CONTEXT.md`, inspect the current checkout and linked contract/tests, then identify the integration boundary owned by this task before changing FinSight ingestion.”
